# forest-simulation
## Created by Guillaume Grosse

## Project in a nutshell
Simulation of forest growth and survival.


## Running the project
- run forest-simulation.ipynb python notebook


## Context
Project : Multi Agent and Distributed Intelligence
Course : Artificial Intelligence
Enginneering Schools Associated : ENSC and ENSEIRB  
Duration : 1 month


## Main features

Trees form forest formations that can grow, expand, send pollens and colonize new territories.

The older the trees grow, the more likely they are to get hit by a lightening : this makes them catch fire, which then spreads to adjacent trees.

After it was destroyed by fire, a forest becomes burnt, and then fertile again.


## Possible improvements

I could be interesting to monitor forest growth with statistics, and test the impact of the different parameters over forest survival.
